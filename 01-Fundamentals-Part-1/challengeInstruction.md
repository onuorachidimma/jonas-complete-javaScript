# CHALLENGE #1

Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula: 

\[ \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{height} \times \text{height}} \]

(mass in kg and height in meters).

Your task is to write some code to help them:

1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables called `massMark`, `heightMark`, `massJohn`, and `heightJohn`.
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula, and store the results in two variables called `BMIMark` and `BMIJohn`.
3. Log the value of `BMIMark` and `BMIJohn` to the console.

**BONUS:** Create a boolean variable `markHigherBMI` containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John. Log it to the console too.

### TEST DATA 1:
- Mark weighs 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall.
- John weighs 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.

### TEST DATA 2:
- Mark weighs 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall.
- John weighs 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall.

ðŸ‘‹ **OPTIONAL:** You can watch my solution in video format in the next lecture.

**IMPORTANT:** The `**` operator is not supported in this editor. Please make sure to use exactly this formula `mass / (height * height)`, and not this one `mass / (height ** 2)`.
